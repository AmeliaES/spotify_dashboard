1. Explore data in R. Find out what data is provided and explore some initial plots that might be interesting to show on a Python dash app.

Ideas:
  - total hours streaming time
- top artist (based on streaming hours)
- top track (based on streaming hours)
- plots of artists vs listening time
- plots of tracks vs listening time
- plots of listening time vs popularity, per track
- as above but look at number of times a track was played, for top artist, track etc.
- most played genres (word cloud or bubble plot)
- track analysis using the track features provided by spotify
